# mctools-pterodactyl
`mctools` is a pterodactyl addon based on Blueprint that provides a suite of Minecraft-related tools. It enhances your server management experience by integrating handy Minecraft utilities into the Pterodactyl panel.

## Installation

1. Ensure Blueprint is installed and running on your panel.

2. Download the addon `.blueprint` file from the releases tab.

3. Transfer it to the Pterodactyl directory (`/var/www/pterodactyl`).

4. Install it using the Blueprint CLI:
```bash
blueprint -install mctools.blueprint
```

## Inspiration
This project is heavily inspired by [`mcutils.com`](https://mcutils.com), which provides a wide range of useful Minecraft tools and utilities. This addon aims to bring similar functionality directly into the Pterodactyl.
